 * not a list anybody else can see. Everything else in this game runs off static
 * files, and this is the single line that changes that.
 *
 * It can point at the same relay as websoccer, or a different one: the relay
 * does not know or care which game is talking to it, and the high score boards
 * are kept apart by the storage key, not by the server.
 *
 * Put the address of your relay here - a Cloudflare Worker (see worker/README.md,
 * free and about two commands) or your own `node server/relay.js` somewhere with
 * a public address. Leave it empty and the game still plays: one player, two
 * players, your own high score table. Only the shared parts go quiet.
